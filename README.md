# Intensity_from_focal_scan
calc I for focal diameter for a focal scan


reads csv 
for given columns can the intensity calculated if additional parameters as pulse duration in [fs] and laser energy [J] are provided. Here the scaling of focal diameter from the columns is [um], a third column gives the q-factor which gives the 
energy content in the focal area.
